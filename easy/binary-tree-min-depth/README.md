### Minimum Depth of a Binary Tree
Problem Statement

Given a root of the binary tree, find the minimum depth of a binary tree.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node to the nearest leaf node.

Constraints:
```
    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105].
    -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
```
